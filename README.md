# sballedk
This repo is for my personal landing site, located at sballe.dk

See Django documentation for any attempt at implementation on your own system, as the entire site is pretty much basic configuration of said framework.

> Powered by Python/Django, Gunicorn and Docker.

## Caution!
Use some sort of proxy in front of Gunicorn, such as Apache or Nginx. 

## Known faults
The site is not 100% responsive, it scales weirdly when on smaller screens. I might have a look at it when I got the time.

## License

## Thanks
I have noted Bootstrap and the creator of the theme in top of the base.html. Please keep them there, should you choose to use this.
